# Cricket-Score-Calculator
An Interactive Cricket Scorecard calculator that allows users to input the details of a cricket match. Once the match details are provided, the program proceeds to simulate the match ball-by-ball, prompting the user to enter the events for every delivery and displays the scorecard after every delivery.
The program simulates a simplified cricket game where the user can input events such as "dot ball", "single", "two runs", "three runs", "four runs", "five runs" and "six runs" and "wicket" for every ball bowled. Based on the user's inputs, the program calculates the score and displays an updated scorecard after every ball, providing real-time feedback and visualizing the progress of the match.
The scorecard will typically show the following details :
    ->Player ID
    ->Player name
    ->Runs scored by each batsman
    ->Runs given by each bowler
    ->Strike rate of batsman
    ->Wickets taken by each bowler
    ->Economy of the bowler
    ->Status of the batsman (out, not-out, yet-to-bat)
    ->Current strike batsman ad non-strike batsman
